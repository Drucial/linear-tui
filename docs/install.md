# Install

## Requirements

A terminal that speaks 256 colors, a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com) for
the navigation tree's folder icons, and a Linear account.

Without a Nerd Font those icons draw as empty boxes. Nothing else depends on
them, so the app still runs. Most terminal fonts have a patched build:

```sh
brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font
```

Then set it as your terminal's font. On other platforms take an archive from
[the Nerd Fonts releases](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases).

Nothing else is needed to run a release binary. Building from source needs
Go 1.24 or later.

zen-linear is an unofficial third-party client, built on Linear's public API.
It is not affiliated with Linear.

## Install

macOS and Linux, on arm64 or amd64:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/praxis-labs-io/zen-linear/main/install.sh | sh
```

Windows, on arm64 or amd64:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/praxis-labs-io/zen-linear/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both take the binary for your machine, check it against the checksums the
release publishes, and refuse to install anything that does not match. On any
other platform:

```sh
go install github.com/praxis-labs-io/zen-linear/cmd/zen-linear@latest
```

Or from a clone, which is what you want if you intend to change anything:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/praxis-labs-io/zen-linear.git
cd zen-linear
make install
```

`install.sh` and `make install` both put the binary in `~/.local/bin`;
`install.ps1` puts it in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\zen-linear`. `INSTALL_DIR`
moves either. `go install` writes to `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` and takes neither.

`VERSION` pins either installer to a release, as `VERSION=v0.2.0`. Without it
the latest is installed.

Homebrew is not supported.

## PATH

Some shells do not carry `~/.local/bin` on PATH. If the installer says so, add it:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Put that in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` to keep it.

On Windows, if the installer says the directory is not on PATH:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path', "$env:PATH;$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\zen-linear", 'User')
```

Then open a new terminal. Neither installer edits PATH on your behalf.

## Authenticating

Three paths, and they resolve in this order.

**`LINEAR_API_KEY` in the environment wins over everything else.** It is the
override. Exporting one in your shell profile means no other path is reached.

**Browser OAuth** is the default:

```sh
zen-linear auth login     # opens Linear in a browser
zen-linear auth logout    # revokes and removes the stored credentials
```

Credentials land in `~/.zen-linear/credentials.json`, mode 0600, and refresh on
their own. The directory around them is 0700, and is tightened to it if an
older build left it open.

**Per-workspace API keys** are how you run more than one Linear workspace. Each
entry in `workspaces` names an environment variable to read its key from; the
key itself stays out of the config file.

```json
"workspaces": [
  { "name": "Work", "api_key_env": "LINEAR_API_KEY_WORK" },
  { "name": "Personal", "api_key_env": "LINEAR_API_KEY_PERSONAL" }
]
```

Create the keys under Linear's **Settings → API → Personal API keys**, export
them from your shell profile, and switch workspaces with `w`. See
[configuration.md](configuration.md).

## Your first run

```sh
zen-linear
```

The navigation tree loads your teams and the favorites from Linear's sidebar,
the issue list fills, and `?` lists the keys that work where you are.
[guide.md](guide.md) is the tour.

Where things are kept:

    ~/.zen-linear/config.json         settings, or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zen-linear
    ~/.zen-linear/credentials.json    OAuth tokens, 0600
    ~/.zen-linear/session.json        what to reopen on
    ~/.zen-linear/nav-cache.json      the navigation tree, so launch is not blank
    ~/.zen-linear/update-check.json   the last update check
    ~/.zen-linear/app.log             the log

## Upgrading

The app checks once a day whether a newer release has been published, and says
so on the status bar when there is one. The check itself downloads nothing.
Turn it off with `"update_check": false`, or from the settings modal;
[configuration.md](configuration.md) covers what the request does and does not
carry.

To take the release:

```sh
zen-linear update
```

It runs the same installer as a fresh install, into the directory the running
binary is already in, so the copy on your PATH is the one that is replaced.
Quit the app first: the upgrade overwrites the binary it is running from.

Re-running the installer by hand still works, and is what to reach for if the
binary is somewhere you need a different `INSTALL_DIR` for.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/praxis-labs-io/zen-linear/main/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/praxis-labs-io/zen-linear/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

From a clone, `git pull && make install`.

`zen-linear --version` reports what you are running:

```
zen-linear 0.3.0 (commit: 1a2b3c4, built: 2026-08-28T14:00:00Z, darwin/arm64)
```

A binary reporting `dev` was built locally rather than downloaded. That is what
`make install` and `go build` produce, and it is correct for a working tree. It
is never update-checked, though `zen-linear update` still installs the latest
release over it if you ask.

`zen-linear help` lists every command.
